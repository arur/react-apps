# react-apps
A collection of small web applications implemented with React.

This repo includes three separate react applications Stopwatch, Todo and Weather application incorporated in one.

## Stopwatch

This basic application makes use of react state, lifecycle methods. Stop Watch renders a timer that starts automatically when the View loads. "Stop" button pauses the timer. "Reset" button resets the timer to 0. When the timer is 0, the "Stop" button re-labeled as "Start".

## Todo

Todo appliaction displays a text input for the user, where they will be able to write a task. Clicking the button beside the input adds the userâ€™s input to a list of to do items. Blank items are not added to the list. Checking off the checkbox of an item removes the item from the list.
